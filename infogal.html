            "The Constitution of India can be amended, but it requires a special majority in both houses of Parliament, and certain amendments also need ratification by half of the state legislatures.",
            "The Indian Constitution provides for a quasi-federal system, which allows it to function as a federal state with unitary powers during emergencies.",

            "The Indian judiciary is independent of the executive and legislature, ensuring that the courts can safeguard rights without interference from the government.",
            "The Directive Principles of State Policy guide the government in creating a welfare state, focusing on social justice, although they are not enforceable by courts.",
            "The Indian Constitution was inspired by various constitutions worldwide, incorporating elements from the British, Irish, American, and Australian models.",
            "Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is often referred to as the 'heart and soul' of the Constitution because it guarantees the right to constitutional remedies."
